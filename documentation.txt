I created the classic version of asteroids.

The ship accelerates and deccelerates. It rotates, and
goes forward in the direction it's rotated in when the
up arrow key is pressed.

Asteroids are randomly generated with a timer (which 
gets smaller as the game goes on) on the opposite side
of the screen that the ship is. The asteroids array is a 
reused array made of the asteroids class which has a 
PShape array for two different kinds of asteroids (also 
randomly chosen which kind). The asteroids spin and go at 
a constant randomized velocity and become inactive once 
they leave the screen or are hit with a bullet. The asteroids 
break several times until they get to a certain size, and 
then they become inactive the next time they're hit.

Bullets are fired from the direction the ship is facing.
You can only fire a bullet once the timer gets to 0, which 
counts down with each frame. The bullets become inactive
once they hit an asteroid, or if it goes off screen, 
to be reused again.

Ship-asteroid collisions work, and the game is over if an
asteroid hits the ship.

Bullet-asteroid collisions work as well, and the bullet
becomes inactive and the asteroid either breaks apart 
or becomes inactive.

Challenges - The ship does do the classic drifting that
the original asteroids game does. There is also a "Game Over"
screen that displays your last 5 scores. Your current score
displays at the top of the screen. The ship also regenerates
in a random location if you press the down arrow key like
in the original asteroids (but you might die because it might
generate you in the location of an asteroid...)
